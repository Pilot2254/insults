Your skill level is so low that it's practically non-existent. It's like watching a toddler try to play a game meant for adults. Your lack of talent is so glaringly obvious that I can't help but cringe every time you pick up a controller. Honestly, it's a wonder you even bother trying. You should just stick to something more suited to your abilities, like coloring within the lines. Leave the gaming to the real players, because you'll never be anything more than a joke in this world.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if you were playing with your feet instead of your hands. Your lack of talent and constant screw-ups on the battlefield are not only embarrassing for you, but for your entire team

Listen up, {player name}, because I'm about to deliver a hurtful truth: you are hands down the worst player I have ever had the misfortune of playing Valorant with. Seriously, watching you fumble around the map like a lost child with a controller is painful. I mean, are you even trying? Or do you just enjoy being a burden to your team and constantly letting us down? It's like you were born with a natural talent for sucking at this game. And don't even get me started on your aim, it's as if your crosshair has a mind of its own and is determined to miss every shot possible. You are a disgrace to the game of Valorant and I would rather play with a blindfolded toddler than have you on my team. Do us all a favor and uninstall the game, because you are bringing shame to the entire community with your ineptitude. 

Oh, look who it is, the GIGANTIC BIRDFUCKER himself. I mean, really, who taught you how to play Valorant? A blind, one-legged pigeon with a joystick could do a better job than you. Your skills are as non-existent as your brain cells. It's like watching a toddler trying to operate a machine gun. And don't even get me started on your aim, I've seen blindfolded monkeys throw darts with more precision. It's no wonder your team always loses, I mean, they might as well play with a stack of rocks instead of having you on their team. I have to applaud you though, you have managed to become the most bad player in Valorant history. Congrats, I guess? But next time, maybe stick to something more your level, like watching paint dry or counting grains of sand. At least then, you won't be a complete disappointment.

Listen here, offensive bitchzilla. I've seen better gameplay from a malfunctioning bot than what you bring to the battlefield in Valorant. You're about as useful as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. I'd say you should stick to level one tutorial games, but even then I doubt you could handle it. Your aim is like a stormtrooper's, consistently missing every shot and causing chaos for your team. I wouldn't be surprised if the enemy team starts offering you a pity kill, just to put you out of your misery. The only thing you're good at in this game is making everyone else look like a pro in comparison. Do us all a favor and switch to a game more suited for your skills, like "Press the Button" or "Sim City." At least then, you won't be dragging us all down with your terrible plays. So do us all a favor and just stick to being an offensive bitchzilla in the chat, because that's the only place

Listen up, you expired pornprincess! I've seen better aim from a blindfolded toddler with a nerf gun. Your gameplay in Valorant is so atrocious, it's like watching a chicken trying to play chess. You couldn't hit a target if it was standing right in front of you and your reaction time is slower than a sloth on sleeping pills. I swear, every time I see you on my team, I already know it's game over. You're like a walking bad luck charm, bringing down the whole team with your sad excuse for skills. You make me wish I could switch teams just to get away from your disastrous plays. I mean, have you even heard of the concept of practicing? It's clear that you haven't, since every time you pick up a weapon, it's like you're playing with your eyes closed. And don't even get me started on your strategy, or should I say lack thereof?

Listen here, {player name}, you sorry excuse for a gamer. Your playing skills are so abysmal that I'm pretty sure a blindfolded newborn could outplay you. Every time you pick up a controller, it's like watching a herd of elephants trying to dance ballet. It's painful, it's cringeworthy, and it's downright laughable. You are the epitome of failure when it comes to gaming. I mean, let's be real here, even a malfunctioning robot would have better hand-eye coordination than you. I bet your teammates dread seeing your IGN pop up on their screen. They probably let out a collective sigh and mentally prepare for yet another disappointing loss. And don't even get me started on your K/D ratio. It's so low, it's practically in negative numbers. I wouldn't be surprised if even the NPCs in the game have a higher kill count than you. You know, I've heard people say that practice makes perfect.
