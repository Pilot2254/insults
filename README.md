# in-game insults for gamers
Oh god, look who decided to visit my dear old Github repository. It's none other than the infamous Github User! I can't believe you actually had the audacity to click on my code, knowing full well that you would be bombarded with more insults and burns than you can handle. I mean, did you really think you were ready for this? Did you really think you had the mental fortitude to handle the sheer amount of wit and sarcasm that I have so generously sprinkled throughout my code? Oh, how foolish you are. Your mere presence here is a disgrace to all coders out there. Your coding skills are like a joke, a bad joke that no one wants to hear. I bet even your code editor cringes every time you try to type something. And let's not even get started on your programming logic. It's almost as if your brain is wired backwards, with every line of code you write leading to a catastrophic error.
