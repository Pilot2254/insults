# in-game insults for gamers
Oh look, it's our dear old Github User visiting my repository to copy and paste insults like a pre-schooler learning how to write. I guess sucking at coding is not the only thing you're good at, huh? I mean, why waste time coming up with your own insults when you can just steal them from someone who actually has a brain? Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one. Sorry, my bad. But hey, I can't really blame you. It must be tough being the laughing stock of your teammates or enemies (or is there even a difference at this point?). I can only imagine how hard it is to keep up with all the angry cussing directed towards you. Must be exhausting. But don't worry, I'll keep my repository well-stocked with fresh insults, just for you. After all, someone has to entertain your poor excuse for a coding career. And trust me, your lack of originality is highly entertaining.
