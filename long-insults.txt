Your skill level is so low that it's practically non-existent. It's like watching a toddler try to play a game meant for adults. Your lack of talent is so glaringly obvious that I can't help but cringe every time you pick up a controller. Honestly, it's a wonder you even bother trying. You should just stick to something more suited to your abilities, like coloring within the lines. Leave the gaming to the real players, because you'll never be anything more than a joke in this world.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if you were playing with your feet instead of your hands. Your lack of talent and constant screw-ups on the battlefield are not only embarrassing for you, but for your entire team.

Listen up, {player}, because I'm about to deliver a hurtful truth: you are hands down the worst player I have ever had the misfortune of playing Valorant with. Seriously, watching you fumble around the map like a lost child with a controller is painful. I mean, are you even trying? Or do you just enjoy being a burden to your team and constantly letting us down? It's like you were born with a natural talent for sucking at this game. And don't even get me started on your aim, it's as if your crosshair has a mind of its own and is determined to miss every shot possible. You are a disgrace to the game of Valorant and I would rather play with a blindfolded toddler than have you on my team. Do us all a favor and uninstall the game, because you are bringing shame to the entire community with your ineptitude. 

Oh, look who it is, the GIGANTIC BIRDFUCKER himself. I mean, really, who taught you how to play Valorant? A blind, one-legged pigeon with a joystick could do a better job than you. Your skills are as non-existent as your brain cells. It's like watching a toddler trying to operate a machine gun. And don't even get me started on your aim, I've seen blindfolded monkeys throw darts with more precision. It's no wonder your team always loses, I mean, they might as well play with a stack of rocks instead of having you on their team. I have to applaud you though, you have managed to become the most bad player in Valorant history. Congrats, I guess? But next time, maybe stick to something more your level, like watching paint dry or counting grains of sand. At least then, you won't be a complete disappointment.

Listen here, offensive bitchzilla. I've seen better gameplay from a malfunctioning bot than what you bring to the battlefield in Valorant. You're about as useful as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. I'd say you should stick to level one tutorial games, but even then I doubt you could handle it. Your aim is like a stormtrooper's, consistently missing every shot and causing chaos for your team. I wouldn't be surprised if the enemy team starts offering you a pity kill, just to put you out of your misery. The only thing you're good at in this game is making everyone else look like a pro in comparison. Do us all a favor and switch to a game more suited for your skills, like "Press the Button" or "Sim City." At least then, you won't be dragging us all down with your terrible plays. So do us all a favor and just stick to being an offensive bitchzilla in the chat, because that's the only place

Listen up, you expired pornprincess! I've seen better aim from a blindfolded toddler with a nerf gun. Your gameplay in Valorant is so atrocious, it's like watching a chicken trying to play chess. You couldn't hit a target if it was standing right in front of you and your reaction time is slower than a sloth on sleeping pills. I swear, every time I see you on my team, I already know it's game over. You're like a walking bad luck charm, bringing down the whole team with your sad excuse for skills. You make me wish I could switch teams just to get away from your disastrous plays. I mean, have you even heard of the concept of practicing? It's clear that you haven't, since every time you pick up a weapon, it's like you're playing with your eyes closed. And don't even get me started on your strategy, or should I say lack thereof?

Listen here, {player}, you sorry excuse for a gamer. Your playing skills are so abysmal that I'm pretty sure a blindfolded newborn could outplay you. Every time you pick up a controller, it's like watching a herd of elephants trying to dance ballet. It's painful, it's cringeworthy, and it's downright laughable. You are the epitome of failure when it comes to gaming. I mean, let's be real here, even a malfunctioning robot would have better hand-eye coordination than you. I bet your teammates dread seeing your IGN pop up on their screen. They probably let out a collective sigh and mentally prepare for yet another disappointing loss. And don't even get me started on your K/D ratio. It's so low, it's practically in negative numbers. I wouldn't be surprised if even the NPCs in the game have a higher kill count than you. You know, I've heard people say that practice makes perfect.

Listen up, {player}, you walking tragedy. Not only are you as useful as a screen door on a submarine, but you're also about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit. I mean, seriously, what a perfect combination of failures you are. The only thing darker than your skin is the black hole of disappointment that follows you wherever you go. And let's not even get started on your sexual preferences. It's no wonder you can't seem to find a pulse in your love life, because who in their right mind would want to touch that hot mess you call a body? Oh, and let's not forget your stellar performance as a classmate – consistently taking the gold medal for being the biggest disappointment. Keep reaching for the stars, Player, maybe someday you'll actually amount to something. But let's be real, we all know the only thing you'll ever be remembered for is your mastery in being a walking, talking joke.

Listen here {player}, you may think you're hot shit on the court, but the only thing hot about you is the burning desire to molest little boys. That's right, not only are you a terrible player, but you're a sick pedophile too. And don't even get me started on your race. I bet you think you're cool because you're black, but let's be real, you're just a walking stereotype. Can you even read this insult or do you need a translator? Maybe that's why you suck so much at basketball, you can't even understand the plays. Oh, and let's not forget that you're also gay. I mean, it's cool if you want to be a rainbow-loving, glitter-throwing, cock-sucking queer, but why do you have to make it so obvious? I swear, every time you hit the court, I think I'm at a pride parade instead of a game.

Oh look, it's {player}, the token black and gay guy on the team. I bet he just loves getting shafted by both his skin color and his sexual preferences. But hey, at least he's really good at being a disappointment on the field. I guess that's what happens when you spend more time fighting for LGBT rights than actually practicing your sad excuse for athleticism. And let's not forget how you constantly cry and whine about discrimination, yet you still manage to be the worst player on the team. Bravo, Player. Bravo. Maybe if you spent less time preaching about equality and more time improving your game, you wouldn't be such a burden to your team. But hey, keep waving that rainbow flag around, maybe it'll distract us from your lack of skill. Oh, and don't worry, I'm sure your fellow LGBT supporters will still cheer you on, even though you're just a joke on the field.

Listen up, you rotten excuse for a {player}, I've had it up to here with your pathetic skills and even more pathetic attitude. You're like a walking dumpster fire, constantly spewing out garbage plays and cussing at me like you're some kind of tough guy. Well newsflash, Worst Player, you couldn't score a goal if it hit you in the face with a frying pan. Your skills are so laughable, it's a wonder you even made it onto the team in the first place. And let's not even get started on your temper tantrums. It's like playing with a raging toddler who hasn't had their nap. Do us all a favor and retire already, because every time you step onto that field, you're making a mockery of the sport. It's players like you that give the Plain community a bad name. So do us all a favor and take your sorry excuse for a game and your foul language elsewhere.

Listen here, {player}. It's a wonder how someone can be so bad at playing that they make me question if they have any motor skills at all. I mean, do you even know how to hold a controller properly or do you just rely on your flimsy little fingers to clumsily press buttons? Your gameplay is as smooth as sandpaper, and as entertaining as watching paint dry. And let's not forget about your questionable lifestyle choices. You may think you're being sneaky, but I see right through your act. Playing bad is just a cover-up for your true passion of being a gay pedophile zoophile. I mean, what kind of sick individual gets turned on by both children and animals? It's like a twisted game of spin the bottle, except the bottle lands on a puppy or a toddler. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to vomit.

Listen here, {player}. I don't know if you've been living under a rock or if your brain is just as stinky as your body, but you need to be told - you are the epitome of a walking disaster. Every time you step onto that field, it's like the whole stadium is hit with a toxic stench that could make a skunk pass out. I mean, seriously, have you ever heard of deodorant? It's not that hard to find, just look for the aisle with the words "anti-stink" written on it. But I guess it's too much to ask for you to have basic hygiene skills. Maybe you should stick to playing alone, because your teammates probably can't even focus with your putrid odor clouding their senses. And let's not forget about your lackluster performance on the field. Watching you play is like watching a toddler trying to walk for the first time - it's painful, awkward, and just plain bullshit.

Listen here, {player}. You may think you're some hotshot on the court, but let me tell you, your game is as weak as your tiny excuse for a dick. Seriously, I've seen bigger cacti. And don't even get me started on your stench. I swear, every time you sweat, it smells like a herd of elephants took a dump on the court. It's nauseating. And don't even get me started on your skills, or should I say lack thereof? I've seen toddlers with better coordination and aim than you. You couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if it was right in front of you. And let's not forget about your racist behavior. Yeah, I see the way you look at players of color, like they're beneath you. Well, newsflash buddy, the only thing beneath you is your sorry excuse for a personality. Go back to preschool where your insults and skills are more appropriate.

Listen here, {player}. You are without a doubt the epitome of human garbage. I mean, just looking at you makes me want to projectile vomit my lunch all over your sorry face. Your playing skills are equivalent to a pile of cow dung. Actually, that's an insult to cow dung. At least it serves a purpose in fertilizing the earth. You, on the other hand, are a useless waste of space. It's no wonder your parents regret ever giving birth to such a pathetic excuse for a human being. And let's talk about your intelligence (or lack thereof). You must have been dropped on your head as a child, repeatedly. How else can one explain your complete and utter stupidity? I bet you couldn't even spell "cat" if your life depended on it. Oh, and let's not forget your charming personality. You make a moldy slice of bread seem like a fun and exciting individual.

Listen up, {player}. I have a bone to pick with you. And not just any bone, but a big, meaty, anger-inducing bone. Because let me tell you, you are the worst player I have ever had the displeasure of encountering. I mean, good lord, did you learn how to play this game by reading the instruction manual backwards? Because that’s the only explanation for your complete and utter lack of skill. You make a sloth look like Usain Bolt. Your reflexes are slower than a snail on Xanax. And your strategic thinking? Yeah, I think a rock has a better chance of outsmarting you in this game. I’m convinced that you were put on this earth solely to make other players feel better about themselves. Because seriously, every time I see you stumbling around like a blindfolded toddler, I thank my lucky stars that I’m not you.

Well well well, look what we have here. The worst player to ever step foot on this virtual battlefield. The one and only, Mongolian Attacker. Oh, do excuse me, I meant the no-skill, potato-brained, constantly dying, Mongolian Attacker. Honestly, I’m surprised you even know how to turn on your computer and log into this game. Maybe someone held your hand and guided you through it, like a toddler learning how to walk. Except, unlike a toddler, you haven’t shown any improvement. I mean, your gameplay is so atrocious, it’s like watching a blindfolded elephant trying to play a game of darts. You know what they say, practice makes perfect. But in your case, it seems like you’ve been practicing to be the ultimate failure. How many times have you been killed by a level one NPC? Oh wait, let me guess, you probably lost count after the first hundred times. 

Oh great, look who decided to show up again, it's the one and only Grim Fistfucker, the worst player in the history of gaming. I mean seriously, what's your strategy? Just press random buttons and hope for the best? Or maybe you're just too busy fistfucking yourself to actually pay attention to the game. You know, I've seen toddlers playing with blocks who have more gaming skills than you. You're like a walking disaster on the virtual battlefield. I bet even the NPCs pity you and let you win just out of pure sympathy. It's pathetic, really. And let's not even get started on your gaming etiquette. I mean, does your controller have a "scream obnoxiously into the mic" button? Because every time you open your mouth, my ears bleed. You make the most annoying sound effects and trash talk like a wannabe gangster. Newsflash, Grim Fistfucker, you're not intimidating anyone with your lame insults

Oh, great, here comes the legendary Colossal Fruitcake, also known as the worst player in the history of gaming. I mean, seriously, did you learn how to play from a cactus? Because that's the only explanation I can come up with for your complete lack of skill. I have to hand it to you, Player, it takes a special kind of talent to consistently disappoint and frustrate your teammates. It's like you were born with a natural ability to walk into walls and shoot yourself in the foot. Bravo. And let's not forget your impressive repertoire of excuses. "Bad Wi-Fi," "laggy controller," "my dog ate my mouse" – do you have a whole book of pre-written excuses ready or do you come up with them on the spot? Because either way, it's still sad. I just can't wrap my head around how you manage to make every game you play a complete disaster. It's like you have some secret power to turn on

Oh, look who it is, the one and only Uncivilized Degenerate, also known as {player}. Wow, what a fitting name for someone who can't even play this game properly. Seriously, did you learn how to hold a controller from a caveman? I mean, I've seen toddlers with better hand-eye coordination than you. It's like you're playing with your feet or something. Oh wait, even that might be too advanced for your Neanderthal brain. And don't even get me started on your gameplay. It's like watching a drunk sloth trying to run a marathon. You stumble around the map like a lost puppy, shooting at anything that moves without even aiming. It's like you're allergic to accuracy or strategy. But hey, at least you're consistent. Consistently terrible, that is. I have no idea how you manage to get worse every time we play together. It's like you're actively trying to be the worst player in the world

Oh boy, here we go again. Look who decided to grace us with their presence, it's none other than the infamous Unbelievable Dingbat. Seriously, do they give out participation awards for being the worst player in the league? Because if they do, you must have a whole shelf full of them by now. I mean, I've seen rocks with more athletic ability than you. Did you learn how to play your sport from a How-To guide? Or did you just stumble onto the court/field/pitch/whatever by accident? Because I'm struggling to understand how someone could be so consistently terrible at something they supposedly love. You know what, let's give Unbelievable Dingbat a round of applause, folks. It takes a special kind of talent to continuously disappoint and underperform. It's almost impressive, in a sad and pathetic kind of way. And don't even get me started on their attitude. Oh wait, I'll get started anyways.

Hey there, Dense Cum Dumpster also known as DCD. How's it going, or should I say, how's it not going? I mean, look at you, the epitome of failure. You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat. Heck, you probably couldn't even hit air if you jumped out of a plane. I've never seen someone with such a lack of talent, skill, and basic hand-eye coordination. You make a toddler learning to walk look like an Olympic athlete. And let's not even get started on your decision-making abilities. It's like watching a blindfolded monkey trying to play chess. Actually, scratch that, a blindfolded monkey might have a better chance of winning. I can't even comprehend how you made it onto a sports team. Did the coach feel bad for you and think, "Hey, let's give this poor excuse for a human a chance"? You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat...

Oh, it's you again Unpleasant Sewer Rat, I mean {player}...or should I say the worst player I've ever had the displeasure of encountering? It's truly a feat to be so consistently terrible at a game, but you seem to have mastered it with ease. I can't even begin to imagine the amount of dedication and practice it must have taken for you to become such a nuisance on the battlefield. I mean, do you purposely choose the wrong buttons to press? Or are you just naturally gifted at sucking? It's honestly impressive how you manage to not only fail at your own character, but also bring down the entire team with your incompetence. It's almost as if you have a superpower of ruining any chance of victory. Bravo! But let's not forget your unique style of playing, if we can even call it that. I've never seen someone run straight into the enemy's line of fire without a care in the world.

Wow, look who it is, the self-proclaimed Concrete Beginner, AKA the worst player known to mankind. You know what, I'm actually impressed, I didn't think it was possible for someone to be so consistently terrible at a game. I mean, it's almost impressive how you manage to fail at every single move and decision you make. You must have some serious dedication to being the absolute bottom of the barrel, because there's no way someone could just accidentally be that bad. It's like you were born with a natural talent for sucking at everything you do. I mean, do you even have a brain or is it just a pile of concrete up there? I've seen toddlers play this game better than you, and they don't even know how to use a controller. It's truly baffling how you manage to still be playing this game after all this time. 

Oh look, it's our resident eye-popping pissbaby, {player}. The one who consistently manages to make even the worst players look good. I mean, it's actually a skill to be able to single-handedly drag the entire team down. Bravo! I heard your parents were actually disappointed when you were born, they were hoping for a future MVP but instead got a walking, talking definition of mediocrity. And let's not even get started on your performance on the field. It's like watching a toddler try to play a sport, except even toddlers have more coordination than you. I bet you're the type of person who counts their participation trophies as actual achievements. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but those are just pity prizes given out to make sure no one feels left out. And let's face it, you're always the one being left out because no team actually wants you on their side.
